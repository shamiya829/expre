# Circulation & Behavior Mapping Template

## 1) Map the plan
- Mark entries, anchors, event pads, restrooms, vertical circulation.
- Identify the “loop” (or lack of one).

## 2) Observe (30–60 minutes per time block)
Capture:
- Desire lines: where people actually walk
- Dwell nodes: where people pause and why
- Bottlenecks: where flow breaks
- Dead zones: low traffic, low dwell

## 3) Diagnose
- Which nodes should be conversion points?
- What’s missing: shade, seating, sightline, signage, activation?

## 4) Interventions to test
- Add a micro-anchor (kiosk/vendor/art)
- Improve sightline to an anchor
- Adjust seating placement and density
- Add signage cues (wayfinding language)

## 5) Measure after changes
- Footfall shift by node
- Dwell time shift by node
- Queue time change
