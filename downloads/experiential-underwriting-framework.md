# Experiential Underwriting Framework (Starter)

Treat experience like a business with inputs → mechanisms → outputs.

## 1) Inputs
**Capex**
- Public realm comfort (shade, seating, surfaces)
- Event infrastructure (power, storage, access)
- Wayfinding and legibility
- Acoustic and lighting improvements

**Opex**
- Guest services / community managers
- Cleaning and safety standards
- Programming budget
- Data collection and reporting

## 2) Mechanisms (what the inputs change)
- Dwell time increases (because comfort + reasons to stay)
- Conversion improves (because spend points intersect flow)
- Revisit improves (because ritual + community + service consistency)
- Tenant health improves (because stable demand)

## 3) Outputs (what to model)
- Tenant sales productivity (supporting rent)
- Leasing velocity and retention
- Ancillary revenue (events, sponsorship, memberships)
- Turnover and downtime reduction

## 4) Risk questions
- Who owns the operating system (org chart)?
- What happens if programming underperforms?
- Can the space adapt without heavy capex?
- What are the privacy and reputational risks of measurement?
