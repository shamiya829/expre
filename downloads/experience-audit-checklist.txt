EXPERIENCE AUDIT CHECKLIST (Starter)

Use this on site walks. Score each item 1–5 and capture notes + photos.

1) ARRIVAL + ORIENTATION
- Is it instantly clear where to enter?
- Is there a “rendezvous point” for groups?
- Is wayfinding readable from a distance?
- Is parking/transit arrival comfortable and safe?

2) PUBLIC REALM COMFORT
- Shade coverage where people naturally pause
- Seating variety (perch / lounge / communal)
- Thermal comfort (sun/wind management)
- Acoustics (is it too loud to talk?)
- Cleanliness (restrooms especially)

3) SOCIAL LOGIC
- Is the environment designed for groups?
- Are there photo moments that don't create bottlenecks?
- Are there places to linger without buying immediately?

4) DISCOVERY + FLOW
- Is there a loop or does circulation dead-end?
- Are there “reasons to turn” (anchors, sights, smells)?
- Are dead zones obvious? Why?

5) CONVERSION POINTS
- Where does attention become spending?
- Are F&B / merch / ticketing placed near dwell nodes?
- Are queues managed (and not miserable)?

6) PROGRAMMING + LIFE
- Does the place feel “alive” on a normal day?
- Is there an event pad with power/access/storage?
- Is there a visible calendar (on site + online)?

7) SERVICE STANDARDS
- Do staff behave like hosts or like guards?
- Is there a clear service recovery process?
- Are safety and security present without killing vibe?

8) MEASUREMENT (IF YOU HAVE ACCESS)
- Footfall by node / zone
- Dwell time by node
- Queue time
- Event conversion (views → RSVPs → attendance)
- Revisit rate / loyalty proxy

OUTPUT
- Top 3 friction points (what makes people leave)
- Top 3 demand amplifiers (what makes people stay/share)
- 3 highest-ROI interventions for next 90 days
