# Data Collection & Heat-Mapping Guide (Starter)

Use measurement to make decisions, not to collect dashboards.

## What to measure
- Footfall by zone
- Dwell time by zone
- Queue time at key friction points
- Event conversion (views → RSVPs → attendance)
- Tenant sales proxy (if available)

## How to collect (low to high lift)
- Manual counts + observation sheets (fast start)
- Ticketing / booking data
- WiFi / Bluetooth analytics (privacy-aware)
- Sensors/counters for key entries and nodes

## Where to place counters
- Main entries
- Anchors
- Event pad edges
- Dead zones (to validate or disprove assumptions)

## Privacy notes
- Prefer aggregated, anonymous data.
- Post signage if collecting via WiFi/Bluetooth.
- Keep a simple data retention policy.

## Make it actionable
- Define 5 KPIs, set baseline, review monthly.
- Keep a “decision log” linking changes → KPI movement.
