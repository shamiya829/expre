# Tenant Mix Framework (Starter)

Tenant mix is a narrative system, not a spreadsheet.

## 1) Define the experience thesis
- Who is the primary user?
- What is the “reason to show up”?
- What is the signature loop (arrival → discovery → dwell → conversion)?

## 2) Build the mix ladder
**Magnet experiences**
- Destinations that motivate a visit (venues, iconic F&B, curated markets)

**Staples**
- High-frequency uses that build habit (coffee, services, daily needs)

**Discovery**
- Local, rotating, and limited formats (pop-ups, makers, drops)

**Social spend**
- Uses designed for groups and late dayparts (bars, dessert, games)

## 3) Adjacency rules (simple)
- Put magnets on the loop, not at dead ends.
- Place conversion points near dwell nodes.
- Cluster compatible sounds/smells; buffer incompatible ones.
- Use “soft edges” (outdoor seating, kiosks) to animate circulation.

## 4) A quick mix check
- Can you explain the mix in one sentence?
- Do you have a day-to-night ladder?
- Is there a repeatable programming rhythm?
- Do you have dead zones? If yes, what’s the fix (anchor, sightline, service)?
